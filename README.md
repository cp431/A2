- Strict adherence to the SHARCNET etiquette (as per the course outline) is required.
- Refer to the course outline for details on the assignment submission instructions.
- Write C/MPI code to implement the parallel merging algorithm to merge two sorted arrays of numbersseen in class.
- Test your code with several examples of large (randomly generated) arrays of numbers.1
